# Machine Learning Resources

here we expect to create an enviroment of all projects done grouped and upgrade them all! also develop new kaggle challenges and other kind of data analysis divided in:

- projects (kaggle competitions, data analysis, statistic analysis and computational simulations)
- resources (useful codes to make our developer life easier)

you can use the kaggle api to download most of the datasets, check it out here: https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api example:

> kaggle competitions download -c tabular-playground-series-may-2021
> Expand-Archive .\tabular-playground-series-may-2021.zip -DestinationPath .
